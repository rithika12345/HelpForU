# HelpForU
Corona virus is a global crisis and the biggest challenge we have faced in our life time.
We have seen many people dying because they were unable to find a proper hospital in proper time. Also there
are many issues that everyone is facing like lack of bed in hospital, ventilators, hygiene, etc.
We are thinking of tackling these problems by designing a website.
Sometimes some hospitals get completely filled while some remains empty but due to lack of proper
information and management people face problems in finding such empty hospitals. To solve this problem we
will mention the name of the hospital and the bed availability in that particular hospital every hour.
Once a person finds a proper hospital with bed, a lot of time will be saved and the person will get the treatment
in proper time without unnecessarily roaming around.
We will also mention the number of covid patients admitted in a particular hospital in our website. Through this
people suffering from other health ailments can have prior information about it and can decide the hospital
accordingly keeping in mind about the risk of getting infected from the virus.
We will also add different kinds of booking systems so that the patient can book their seats in prior so that in
reaching the hospital the treatment will start as soon as possible.
Our main motive is to help people in any way we can so that there is no unnecessary loss of lives and people
can get their treatments done smoothly without any chaos.
